**17/1/2019**:

I finished watching the first lecture video from this year's Deep Learning course  
The lecture is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5xeyoRL95U) on Youtube  

Ran the code from DeepLearningBasics.ipynb  
The code in the notebook worked fine locally(except for few modifications)  
However, I faced issues with OpenCV code when running the same on Colab  
I had problems with using OpenCV on Colab before as well  
Raised a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/issues/11)  

Note : When running a notebook which has all the code ready, make sure you type the code yourself instead of simply running each cell from the original notebook
